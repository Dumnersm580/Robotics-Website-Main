# Java Resources

Our team uses Java to code the robot, primarily because Harker also teaches Java in CS classes. Other langauges that are common among other teams are C++, LabView, and Python.

A working knowledge of Java is important in learning FRC programming, especially once the program constructs are introduced. Concepts like the command-based system and robot lifecycle are much easier to understand if you have a programming background. However, in general the curriculum is designed to be useful to those even without programming experience. If you've completed Advanced Programming or higher you should be fine, otherwise if you haven't learned Java or know another language, it is highly recommended to learn or refresh yourself in Java syntax. Below are a list of resoucres, tutorials, and videos that can assist your learning.
