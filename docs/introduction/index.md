# Introduction

The software docs are designed to act both as training material as well as a quick refrerence for those looking to refresh their knowledge or learn a little about how software works. It's divided into three sections: Introduction, Basic Concepts, and Advanced Concepts.

-   The [Introduction](.) section is designed to be a "Week 1" training set, which goes over how to get set up to write software and some of the fundamental concepts that we use.
-   The [Basic Concepts](../basic/) include those that are used in every codebase, and make up the vast majority of the code we write. Any software member looking to make significant contributions should master these concepts, as a thorough understanding of them will allow you to quickly write code and provide a foundation to learn the more advanced concepts.
-   The [Advanced Concepts](../advanced/) are those that may not be used every year or ones that are complicated enough that we use an external library to provide their functionality. These should only be tackled if you are very comfortable with the basic conepts.

It's important to know that the docs are intended as a supplement to normal training presentations and projects. Reading these pages alone will not help you learn, you need to actually open an editor and write some original code. Copying from the docs won't help you learn, even if it writing code feels challenging at first.

If you have any extra questions or comments about any of the material, feel free to send a message in #software.
